Welcome to the EchoVR texture editor,

App is now easy and simple to use, click tutorial in top left if you get stuck.

Any questions message @he_is_the_cat on discord and special thanks to Exhibitmark for creating the original extraction tool and Goopsie for making it easier to use.

IMPORTANT --> when making your dds textures do not use a converter, instead use a photo editor and export as dds, a free online tool is https://www.photopea.com, "drag and drop, edit it then export -> more -> dds" here you can lock the resolution and change it also.

This now works with quest standalone, download quest data from https://mia.cdn.echo.taxi/_data.zip.
